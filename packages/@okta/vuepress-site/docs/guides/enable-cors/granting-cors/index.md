title: Grant cross-origin access to websites
---

You can enable CORS for websites that need cross-origin requests to the Okta API.

1. Select **Security** and then **API**.
1. Select the **Trusted Origins** tab.
1. Select **Add Origin** and then enter a name for the organization origin.
1. In the **Origin URL** box, specify the base URL of the website that you want to allow cross-origin requests from.
1. Make sure that **CORS** is selected as the **Type**. You can also enable the **Redirect** setting, which allows for redirection to this Trusted Origin after a user signs in or out.
1. Click **Save**.

> **Note:** If you don't enable CORS, or disable it at a later date, the list of websites is retained.
